# LemLib

Welcome to LemLib! This open-source PROS template aims to introduce common algorithms like Pure Pursuit and Odometry for new and experienced teams alike.

LemLib only supports differential drivetrains.

The creation of this template was inspired by [EZ-Template](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template) and [OkapiLib](https://github.com/OkapiLib/OkapiLib). We aim to develop a library that strikes a balance between ease-of-use, akin to that of EZ-Template, and comprehensive functionality, similar to that of OkapiLib.
